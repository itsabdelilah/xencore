# These rules are applied when building the library itself

# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# By default, the flags in this file are appended to flags specified
# in /path/to/sdk/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt

# Most rules are in consumer-rules.pro which are applied to consuming apps
